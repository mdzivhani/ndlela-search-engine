# Project Execution Guide

This guide applies to both contributors and automated agents working in the repository.

## Approach and Expected Behaviour

- Follow the documented project standards before creating or modifying code.
- If specifications are unclear, create placeholders and log tasks for refinement.
- Apply Test Driven Development. Write tests first.
- Ensure all code remains readable, maintainable, and scalable.

## General Principles

- Prioritise function over complexity.
- Avoid duplicated logic.
- Use meaningful names for variables, methods, services, and components.
- Keep commits small and focused.

## Workflow

1. Confirm requirements.
2. Write failing tests.
3. Design the solution.
4. Implement and refine.
5. Document changes.
