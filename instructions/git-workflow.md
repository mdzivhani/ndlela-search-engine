# Git Workflow and Commit Guidelines## Branch Strategy### Main Branches#### main / master- Production-ready code- Always deployable- Protected branch - no direct commits- Only merge through pull requests#### develop- Integration branch for features- Pre-production code- Protected branch- Base for feature branches### Supporting Branches#### Feature Branches- **Naming**: feature/short-description- **Base**: develop- **Merge into**: develop- **Lifetime**: Until feature is completeExamples:feature/add-user-authenticationfeature/product-catalogfeature/data-processing#### Bugfix Branches- **Naming**: bugfix/short-description- **Base**: develop- **Merge into**: developExamples:bugfix/fix-payment-calculationbugfix/resolve-memory-leakbugfix/correct-date-formatting#### Hotfix Branches- **Naming**: hotfix/short-description- **Base**: main- **Merge into**: main AND develop- **Use**: Critical production issues onlyExamples:hotfix/security-vulnerabilityhotfix/critical-data-loss#### Release Branches- **Naming**: release/version-number- **Base**: develop- **Merge into**: main AND develop- **Use**: Prepare for production releaseExamples:release/1.2.0release/2.0.0-beta## Commit Messages### Structure&lt;type&gt;: &lt;subject&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;footer&gt;### TypeUse one of these prefixes:- **feat**: New feature- **fix**: Bug fix- **refactor**: Code refactoring (no functional change)- **perf**: Performance improvement- **style**: Formatting, missing semi-colons, etc. (no code change)- **test**: Adding or updating tests- **docs**: Documentation changes- **build**: Build system or dependencies- **ci**: CI/CD configuration changes- **chore**: Maintenance tasks### Subject Line- Use imperative mood: "Add feature" not "Added feature"- No period at the end- Capitalize first letter- Keep under 50 characters- Be specific and descriptive? **Good Examples**:feat: Add user authentication with JWTfix: Resolve null reference in payment processorrefactor: Extract validation logic to separate serviceperf: Optimize database query for user lookuptest: Add unit tests for DataTransformerdocs: Update API documentation for product endpoints? **Bad Examples**:Added stuffFixed bugChangesWIPasdfghUpdate code### Body (Optional)- Separate from subject with blank line- Explain **what** and **why**, not **how**- Wrap at 72 characters- Use bullet points for multiple changesExample:feat: Add data processing for incoming streams\- Implement optimized streaming algorithm\- Add feature flag to enable/disable processing\- Reduce data size by up to 95%This improves performance when transmitting dataover limited bandwidth connections and reducesstorage requirements.### Footer (Optional)- Reference issues/tickets- Note breaking changesCloses #123Fixes #456Relates to #789BREAKING CHANGE: API endpoint /users now requires authentication### Complete Examplefeat: Add data processing with feature toggleImplement the streaming algorithm to processincoming data before transmission. The processing canbe enabled/disabled via Kubernetes configuration.\- Add DataProcessor with configurable tolerance\- Add DataProcessingFeatureFlag\- Update MessageHandler to use processor\- Add unit tests with real data samplesDefault: disabled - enable for smaller environments first toobserve impact before wider rollout.Relates to JIRA-1234## Pull Requests### Creating Pull Requests#### Title- Clear and descriptive- Include ticket number if applicable- Use same conventions as commit messagesfeat: Add user authentication (JIRA-123)fix: Resolve memory leak in data processing (JIRA-456)#### Description Template\### Description&lt;Describe your changes&gt;\### Type of Change\- \[ \] Bug fix\- \[ \] New feature\- \[ \] Breaking change\- \[ \] Documentation update\### Testing\- \[ \] Unit tests pass\- \[ \] Integration tests pass\- \[ \] Manual testing completed\### Checklist\- \[ \] Code follows style guidelines\- \[ \] Self-reviewed the code\- \[ \] Added/updated tests\- \[ \] Added/updated documentation\- \[ \] No warnings or errors introduced\- \[ \] Link to Jira ticket\### Screenshots (if applicable)&lt;Add screenshots&gt;### PR Best Practices- **Keep PRs Small**: < 400 lines changed ideally- **Single Purpose**: One feature/fix per PR- **Self-Review**: Review your own code first- **Context**: Provide sufficient context for reviewers- **Tests**: Include relevant tests- **Documentation**: Update docs as needed- **Draft PRs**: Use for work in progress to get early feedback### PR LabelsUse labels to categorize PRs:- bug - Bug fixes- feature - New features- enhancement - Improvements- documentation - Documentation changes- breaking-change - Breaking changes- needs-review - Ready for review- work-in-progress - Not ready for review- blocked - Blocked by dependencies## Code Review Guidelines### For Authors#### Before Creating PR- Code is complete and tested- All tests pass locally- Code follows style guidelines- Self-reviewed the changes- Documentation updated- No debug code or commented-out code- Meaningful commit messages#### During Review- Respond to all comments- Be open to feedback- Explain your reasoning- Make requested changes promptly- Re-request review after changes### For Reviewers#### What to Review**Functionality**- Does it work as intended?- Are edge cases handled?- Is error handling appropriate?**Code Quality**- Is it readable and maintainable?- Does it follow conventions?- Is it well-structured?- Are there code smells?**Testing**- Are tests comprehensive?- Do tests verify behavior?- Are edge cases tested?**Performance**- Are there performance implications?- Are queries optimized?- Are resources managed properly?**Security**- Are inputs validated?- Are there security vulnerabilities?- Is sensitive data protected?#### How to Review- **Understand Context**: Read the description and linked tickets- **Check Out Code**: Test locally if needed- **Review Thoroughly**: Don't rush- **Be Constructive**: Provide helpful feedback- **Ask Questions**: If something is unclear- **Suggest Improvements**: But distinguish required vs. optional- **Approve When Ready**: All concerns addressed#### Comment TypesUse conventional comment prefixes:- **?? Required**: Must be fixed before merge?? This will cause a null reference exception- **?? Suggestion**: Nice to have, but optional?? Consider extracting this to a separate method- **?? Question**: Need clarification?? Why is this check necessary?- **?? Praise**: Acknowledge good work?? Nice solution!- **?? Note**: Informational?? This could be simplified using LINQ### Review Response Times- **Urgent**: 2 hours- **Normal**: 1 business day- **Low Priority**: 2 business days## Merging### Merge Strategies#### Squash and Merge (Preferred)- Combines all commits into one- Clean, linear history- Use for most feature branches#### Merge Commit- Preserves all individual commits- Use for release branches- Use when commit history is important#### Rebase and Merge- Replays commits on target branch- Linear history without merge commits- Use carefully to avoid history confusion### Before Merging- All required approvals received- All CI/CD checks pass- All review comments addressed- Branch is up to date with target- No merge conflicts### After Merging- Delete the source branch- Update linked tickets/issues- Notify relevant team members- Monitor deployment if auto-deployed## Commit Hygiene### Commit Often- Make small, logical commits- Each commit should be a complete thought- Don't mix unrelated changes### Clean Up Before PushUse interactive rebase to:- Squash work-in-progress commits- Fix commit messages- Reorder commits logicallygit rebase -i HEAD~5 # Last 5 commits### Atomic CommitsEach commit should:- Work independently- Pass all tests- Have a single purpose- Be reversible## Git Commands Reference### Basic Workflow\# Start new featuregit checkout developgit pull origin developgit checkout -b feature/my-feature\# Make changes and commitgit add .git commit -m "feat: Add my feature"\# Push to remotegit push origin feature/my-feature\# Update with latest developgit checkout developgit pull origin developgit checkout feature/my-featuregit merge develop\# orgit rebase develop\# Delete branch after mergegit branch -d feature/my-featuregit push origin --delete feature/my-feature### Useful Commands\# View commit historygit log --oneline --graph --all\# Amend last commitgit commit --amend\# Undo last commit (keep changes)git reset --soft HEAD~1\# Undo last commit (discard changes)git reset --hard HEAD~1\# Stash changesgit stashgit stash pop\# Cherry-pick commitgit cherry-pick &lt;commit-hash&gt;\# View changesgit diffgit diff --staged\# Clean untracked filesgit clean -fd## Handling Common Scenarios### Fixing a Typo in Last Commit\# Make the fixgit add .git commit --amend --no-editgit push --force-with-lease### Resolving Merge Conflictsgit merge develop\# Fix conflicts in editorgit add .git commit### Splitting a Large Commitgit reset HEAD~1git add -p # Interactively stage changesgit commit -m "First part"git add -pgit commit -m "Second part"### Recovering Deleted Branchgit refloggit checkout -b recovered-branch &lt;commit-hash&gt;## Best Practices Summary- **Commit Early, Commit Often**: Small, frequent commits- **Write Good Messages**: Clear, descriptive commit messages- **Keep Branches Short-Lived**: Merge frequently to avoid conflicts- **Review Your Own Code**: Before requesting review- **Be Responsive**: Address review comments promptly- **Keep History Clean**: Use rebase/squash appropriately- **Protect Important Branches**: Use branch protection rules- **Automate Checks**: Use CI/CD to validate changes- **Document Decisions**: Use PR descriptions and commit bodies- **Communicate**: Keep team informed of significant changes
